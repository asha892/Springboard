## Predicting the number of empty seats for an airline by month 
  * Predicting the number of empty seats ahead of time can help airlines to take actions for maximising reservation / reducing the planned number of flights.
  * We can even further classify it to predict the percentage of empty seats in first business and economy classes.
  * Dataset: http://www.aviationdb.com/Aviation/SeatUtilizationByCarrier.shtm#SUBMIT
  ** This dataset has data about the seat utilization for multiple airlines by month for the last 18 years.

## Predicting the commonly bought groups of items
  * Predicting the items bought together often by customers will help the stores organize the items better to increase sales.
  * Dataset: https://rdrr.io/cran/arules/man/Groceries.html

## Predicting the growth of Facebook users
  * Keeping in mind about the recent facebook security issues, there are speculations that there is a decline in the number of users.
