# WRANGLING REPORT

## CLEANED AND WRANGLED DATA IN A USABLE FORM
  * Renaming the column names in a readable format and deleting the columns that will be of no use for the project.  
  * Replacing all the invalid cells with NA
  * Deleting rows with zero seats as they are outliers for the dataset.
  * Removing carriers that do not have data for atleast 12 months because that would be insufficient data for predicting any useful information for that airline
  ## SUMMARY
  * The original dataset had 13000 rows. After wrangling we now have 9656 rows in the cleaned dadtaset.
